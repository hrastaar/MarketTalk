# MarketTalk Application 
MarketTalk is an iOS application that is essentially a chatroom for people to join
and learn more about the stock market. People can interact with each other and ask
questions, learn new concepts they didn't know prior, and educate others on stock
market information!

I chose to angle this project as a Stock-Market themed application because I have 
always been interested in how the market works and always read as much about 
current events as I can and online forums and resources have personally helped 
me learn new concepts and strategies when analyzing the market. This application
is different in that it's general group-chat base allows people to talk to as 
many people as there are on the app.

## Technology Used

### Firebase

This application uses Google Firebase to manage the data for user logins, registration,
and saving messages for users to look at.

### Chameleon Framework

Allows for more subtle, easy-to-access color combinations and designs.

### SVProgressHUD

This API is a simple progress monitor that keeps rolling until an operation is 
completed. In this project, it was used to let the user know that their account
was still in the process of being created or logged into.

## Upcoming Progress

I plan to make a user score feature, where users will receive a point for every
contribution they make to the groupchat and that value can be viewed by the 
other members. It will allow experienced and active members to feel appreciated
in a way besides looking the same as the other accounts!

I plan on improving the UI features to be more user-friendly and beautiful to 
look at. I also plan on creating an "About this page" and "About the creator"
sections that will allow users to learn more about me and what made me want
to do this!

## Learning Resource
